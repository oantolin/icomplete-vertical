;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines a global minor mode to display Icomplete
;; completion candidates vertically.  You could get a vertical display
;; without this package, by using (setq icomplete-separator "\n"), but
;; that has two problems which `icomplete-vertical-mode' solves:
;;
;; 1. Usually the minibuffer prompt and the text you type scroll off
;;    to the left!  This conceals the minibuffer prompt, and worse,
;;    the text you enter.
;;
;; 2. The first candidate appears on the same line as the one you are
;;    typing in.  This makes it harder to visually scan the candidates
;;    as the first one starts in a different column from the others.
;;
;; For users that prefer the traditional horizontal mode for Icomplete
;; but want to define some commands that use vertical completion, this
;; package provides the `icomplete-vertical-do' macro.  For example to
;; define a command to yank from the kill-ring using completion:
;;
;; (defun insert-kill-ring-item ()
;;   "Insert item from kill-ring, selected with completion."
;;   (interactive)
;;   (icomplete-vertical-do (:separator "\n··········\n" :height 20)
;;     (insert (completing-read "Yank: " kill-ring nil t))))
;;
;; Both the :separator and :height are optional and default to
;; icomplete-vertical-separator and to
;; icomplete-vertical-prospects-height, respectively.
;; If you omit both parts you still need to include the empty
;; parenthesis: (icomplete-vertical-do () ...)!.
